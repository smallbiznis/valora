# Railzway — Architecture

## Overview

Railzway is a **proprietary, industrial-strength billing engine** focused on **billing logic correctness**.

It is designed to extract billing concerns—usage metering, pricing, rating, subscriptions, and invoice generation—out of application code and into a **dedicated, deterministic engine**.

Railzway is intentionally **not** a payment processor.
It computes *what should be billed*, not *how money is collected*.

## Licensing & Proprietary Status

Railzway is a **Source Available, Proprietary** project. While the source code is public for transparency and auditability, it is **not** Open Source. Commercial use, redistribution, or modification for competing services requires an explicit license from the copyright holders.

This document describes how Railzway is structured, where its boundaries are, and why those boundaries exist.

## What Railzway Is (and Is Not)

Railzway **is**:

- A billing computation engine
- A control plane for pricing and usage-based billing
- A deterministic system for producing invoices and billing states

Railzway **is not**:

- A payment gateway
- A merchant of record
- A financial settlement system
- An infrastructure or operations platform

This distinction is fundamental to every architectural decision in Railzway.

## Architectural Intent

The architecture of Railzway is driven by three core intents:

1. **Billing logic must be isolated**Billing rules change faster than product logic. Hardcoding them into application flows creates long-term risk.
2. **Billing must be deterministic**Given the same inputs—usage, pricing configuration, subscription state, and time—Railzway must always produce the same result.
3. **Trust boundaries must be explicit**
   High-risk domains (payments, credentials, infrastructure) are deliberately kept outside the engine.

## High-Level Structure

At a high level, Railzway sits between the application and external financial systems.

The application:

- Owns users and authentication
- Emits usage
- Executes payments

Railzway:

- Validates and aggregates usage
- Applies pricing and rating rules
- Manages subscription and invoice state

External systems:

- Execute payments
- Handle identity
- Perform accounting or reconciliation

Railzway never crosses into payment execution.

## Core Runtime Flow

A typical billing lifecycle in Railzway looks like this:

1. The application defines billing primitives:

   - Products
   - Meters
   - Prices (flat, usage-based, tiered, hybrid)
   - Subscriptions
2. The application sends usage events to Railzway.
3. Railzway:

   - Validates usage against meter definitions
   - Aggregates usage per billing period
   - Applies pricing and rating logic
   - Computes billable line items
4. At the billing boundary:

   - An invoice is generated
   - Totals and line items are finalized
   - Invoice state transitions are recorded
5. The application consumes the invoice output and performs payment execution externally.

At no point does Railzway store or process payment credentials.

## Deployment Topology (Hybrid)

Railzway supports two primary deployment models using the same codebase:

### 1. Monolith (All-in-One)
A single binary (`cmd/railzway`) containing all logic and the Admin UI.
- **Best for**: Development, small-scale deployments, low complexity.
- **Docker Image**: `ghcr.io/smallbiznis/railzway`

### 2. Microservices (Granular Planes)
The monolith is sliced into 4 discrete planes for independent scaling:

#### Control Plane (`apps/admin`)
- **Responsibility**: Organization management, configuration, internal dashboards.
- **Scaling**: Low traffic, high availability for staff.

#### Customer Plane (`apps/invoice`)
- **Responsibility**: Public invoice rendering, payment collection UI.
- **Scaling**: High burst capacity (end-of-month traffic).

#### Background Plane (`apps/scheduler`)
- **Responsibility**: Async jobs (rating, ensuring cycles, generating invoices).
- **Scaling**: Throughput-oriented. Configurable via `ENABLED_JOBS` env var (e.g., dedicated workers for rating vs invoicing).

#### Data Plane (`apps/api`)
- **Responsibility**: High-volume programmatic billing API.
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling for API ingestion and queries.

## Internal Composition

Internally, Railzway is structured in layered responsibilities:

- **API layer**

  - Handles HTTP/gRPC transport
  - Enforces authentication and authorization
  - Performs request validation
  - Contains no billing logic
- **Application / service layer**

  - Orchestrates billing workflows
  - Coordinates domain operations
  - Enforces state transitions and invariants
- **Domain layer**

  - Pricing models and rating logic
  - Subscription lifecycle rules
  - Invoice state machines
  - Designed to be deterministic and transport-agnostic
- **Persistence layer**

  - Stores usage records, pricing configuration, subscription state, and invoices
  - Abstracted behind repositories
  - Assumes database security is handled by the deployment environment

This separation exists to keep billing logic testable, auditable, and transferable.

## Trust Boundaries

Railzway operates across clearly defined trust boundaries.
